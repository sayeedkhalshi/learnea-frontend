Education is wrong. The concept of education is so wrong. This concept has driven people to think other way. That we have to learn thing to do it. For that reason people doesn't want to do things because they think it is not logical to do before knowing it. But knowing isn't needed at all. No prior knowledge needed for anything. It's 1% learning gains from education 99% from doing it, if learning is development of neurons. To learnn it to do it brings huge anxiety. Learning isn't rewarding. Working is rewarding. THat;s learning brings anxiety and stress, doing brings up refreshment.

In reality, people just have to do it. To do that will educate themselves what they need and they will attempt developing and learn other 99% from it.

For that what they need is management. People need to learn how to manage their learning, to do that they will learn by doing. People need to know how they learn, learning process. People need to know other unacknowledged parts of their life that aren't managed and manage them. So, their emotions, traps, flow, layers levels etc. Then they need to know the basic building blocks of the universe like motion, vibration, frequency, wave and others and their impact on life and manage them. Basically they need to know everything in human and universe's objective context.

Then they need to know how the economics work. (btw none of them are conventional) Finance, control structure etc. All learn by doing real life management.

So when we learn we learn three things, one the thing we learn, then how we learn(learning techniques evolves), then how to manage those learning. One of the biggest anxiety of learning is how to manage those info I can't handle.
