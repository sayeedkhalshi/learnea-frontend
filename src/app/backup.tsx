                    Welcome to Learnea. Taking civilization to the next level. I
                    always wondered why there has to be only tech startups to
                    revolutionalize civilization. Why not psychological startup
                    that takes humanity to the next level? Is it that
                    impossible? Do you know why sci-fis are wrong? Cause they
                    show humans are still dumb even after 100 years passed. We
                    think aliens think of us dumb. But not anymore. Learnea is
                    gonna change humanity to a superior intelligence species.
                    Learnea is a learning system as smooth as the universe
                    learns. As smooth as our brain can learn. Its a upgrade to
                    our obsolete school system. Social media or courses did help
                    but they have their limit. Learnea is a limitless learning
                    system that connects each of our learnings to each of us to
                    make a bigger and better civilizational learning philosophy.
                    Learnia believes in the law of synchronization and it's
                    taking us to a greater goal of living. Learnea understands
                    how our brain learns. Unlike traditional system, it gives no
                    PTSD, it's healthy. It makes you build things, learn as you
                    need, connects learning, creates learning path for you,
                    create attachment with another human being, have healthy
                    feud, develop project, create team, get job, payments etc.
                    It takes care of your struggle, paint points, support,
                    thinking process as smooth as possible. Learnea uses
                    acknowledgement and unacknowledgement theory proposed by the
                    founder, Abu Sayeed. This two theory are the most important
                    part in human learning mechanism.

                <h3>Control Structure</h3>
                <p>
                    In the human context, anything built is to control
                    something. Another part of that is anxiety Anything is a
                    control structure here Anything can make a control
                    structure. We need a tool that marks how each ting
                    controlling and provides a way to solve the problem of
                    controlling.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Do you think often? Think about life and events. Think about
                    what you are and how to make it right. That thinking is you.
                    It is your life itself. Without that you are nothing. That
                    grown on you. It is you who have grown. That is your
                    phlosophy. That is your lifelong learning.
                </p>

                <p>
                    But more than that, this is how human learns. It is called
                    growing. Absorbing information is not learning, but sleeping
                    on it is. The dumbest person on earth still knows how to
                    learn. This learning happens by following a narrative. The
                    narrative of your life story.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You remember your life story because it keeps up with the
                    continuity of your narrative. Anything doesn't fall into the
                    category of that narrative, gets forgotten.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We are going to celebrate it. I feel you can not keep track
                    of your lifelong learnig. Because we are low bandwidth
                    animal brain. We are weak and organic. We need a place to
                    write them. So we can keep track of what we are and how we
                    could solve our problems. Someone said, your problem is 70%
                    solved when you write it down. Maybe a personal AI companion
                    solely on your own hard drive that knows you.
                </p>
                <p>But there is more</p>

                <p>
                    There are things that are thinking and processing from the
                    very early of your life. From 1 week ago or from 6 months,
                    you had something put in your brain. That is a piece of your
                    life story. That piece of life kept growing. Doing many more
                    complex analysis, doubts and questions every day. Even the
                    most stupid person still has some story built in them. They
                    are more intelligent th similar brain. That story is you.
                    Without that you are nothing. Cause that's you. I want to
                    build a learning system that follows the personal narrative
                    of a person, let them choose and make a system out of it
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you can't manage all your thoughts, you could name
                    them, write them down. Manage them for future
                </p>
                <p>
                    ToDo based learning. AI companion for getting personal and
                    management. Management is bigger than learning. Thread
                    management. Where ocd is created because of unmanaged thread
                    becomes autonomous, OCD
                </p>

                <p>
                    Learning is the primary thing in brain. But it's not the
                    dominate flow. Doing is our subtle flow. We learn when we
                    are stuck. Means, we choose learning when there is anxiety
                </p>
                <p>
                    Force learning is when you call learning a learning. If you
                    call learning a whole process of learning cycle, then
                    learning should be divided into those parts. If you think
                    neuroplasticity is learning, then it's unconscious. So if
                    let our brain do it's part, force learning goes away. Cause
                    learning is{" "}
