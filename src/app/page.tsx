                        traditional systems, it gives no PTSD, it’s healthy. It

                        learning, creates a learning path for you, creates
                        attachment with another human being, has healthy feuds,
                        develops projects, creates teams, gets jobs, payments,

                        the acknowledgment and unacknowledgment theory proposed
                        by the founder, Abu Sayeed. These two theories are the
                        most important part of the human learning mechanism.

                        controls and provides a way to solve the problem of
